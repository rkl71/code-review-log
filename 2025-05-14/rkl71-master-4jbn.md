I'll review the code changes from the git diff records:

1. **CodeReview.java changes**:
   - The change uncomments the `writeLog(token, log)` call, which means the log writing functionality is now enabled.
   - This is a good change if:
     - The `writeLog` method is properly implemented and tested
     - The logging functionality is actually needed in production
     - The token and log data are properly sanitized before writing
   - Potential concerns:
     - Was this previously commented out for a reason? (e.g., performance issues, security concerns)
     - Ensure the logging doesn't contain sensitive information
     - Consider using a proper logging framework instead of System.out.println

2. **ApiTest.java changes**:
   - The test changed from trying to parse "hahahaha123" to "hahahaha" as an integer
   - Both versions will throw NumberFormatException since neither string is a valid integer
   - This seems like a trivial change that doesn't improve the test
   - Recommendations:
     - The test should either:
       - Test valid integer parsing cases
       - Explicitly test for NumberFormatException with invalid input
     - Current test doesn't provide much value
     - Consider adding assertions to verify the expected exception

**Overall Recommendations**:
1. For CodeReview.java:
   - Add input validation for token and log parameters
   - Consider using a logging framework
   - Ensure the writeLog method has proper error handling

2. For ApiTest.java:
   - Either make it a proper negative test case with exception assertion
   - Or replace with meaningful test cases
   - Example improvement:
     ```java
     @Test(expected = NumberFormatException.class)
     public void testInvalidNumberFormat() {
         Integer.parseInt("hahahaha");
     }
     ```

3. General suggestions:
   - Consider adding more context in commit messages about why these changes were made
   - The test change doesn't seem to provide any value in its current form
   - Ensure there are proper tests covering the writeLog functionality that was just enabled

The changes are simple but raise questions about the testing strategy and logging implementation that should be addressed.
