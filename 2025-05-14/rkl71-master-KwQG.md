The provided git diff records show changes to two files: `.github/workflows/main-maven-jar.yml` and `code-review-sdk/src/main/java/com/hanyang/middleware/sdk/CodeReview.java`. Here's a review of the changes:

### `.github/workflows/main-maven-jar.yml`

**Changes:**
- Added two new steps to the GitHub Actions workflow:
  1. `Get Commit Author`: This step captures the author of the last commit and stores it in an environment variable `COMMIT_AUTHOR`.
  2. `Get Commit Branch`: This step captures the current branch name and stores it in an environment variable `COMMIT_BRANCH`.

**Review:**
- This is a good practice to capture metadata such as the commit author and branch name. It can be useful for various purposes, such as logging, versioning, or other custom logic.
- The use of `echo` to set environment variables is appropriate for GitHub Actions.

### `code-review-sdk/src/main/java/com/hanyang/middleware/sdk/CodeReview.java`

**Changes:**
- The `CodeReview` class now reads the `COMMIT_AUTHOR` and `COMMIT_BRANCH` environment variables to construct the file name for logging.
- The original line that generated a random file name is commented out, and the new line incorporates the commit author, branch, and a random string to generate the file name.

**Review:**
- The new file naming scheme incorporating the commit author and branch name is a good approach for creating unique file names that can help in tracking the origin of the log files.
- The commented-out line suggests that the original method of generating a random string for the file name was replaced with the new method. This change seems to be an improvement as it provides more context about the file's origin.
- It's important to ensure that the `generateRandomString` method is secure and generates a sufficiently random string to prevent predictability of the file names.

### Overall Considerations:
- The changes seem to be well-intentioned and add value by incorporating commit and branch information into the file naming.
- It's a good practice to review the impact of these changes on the overall system, especially if the code-review-sdk is used in a distributed environment where multiple developers might be working on different branches.
- Ensure that the new file naming convention is consistent across the system and that any tools or scripts that handle file operations are updated to accommodate the new naming scheme.
